# <Work Day Schedular>

## Description


- I made this website in hopes of aiding those in need and myself of some proper time management for the workday! 
- I built this project to further understand Javascript and to really get behind the logistics as well as to learn how to leverage local storage!
- This website will solve your scheduling needs, feel free to write anything down in the time slots and it will save!
- I learnt how to use a save function in javascript and how to assign classes dynamically.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

In order to use the schedular, visit the deployed website at: https://senkua.github.io/JsSchedular/

Type in your plans for the hour in a text box, 
Then click on the blue save icon.
Refresh the page or leave and come back and it will still be there! 
present timeblock is red, past timeblock is grey and future timeblock is green! It will always adjust based on your timezone.

## Credits

For organizing and commenting code I had a lot of help using https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt

In order to make the schedular I did research on local storage and how to apply it mostly using https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp
